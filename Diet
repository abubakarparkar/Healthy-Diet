    <h1>Your Healthy Diet Plan</h1>

    <div class="meal">
        <h2>Breakfast: Energize Your Day</h2>
        <p>Start your morning with a delicious bowl of <strong>oatmeal</strong>, topped with fresh <strong>fruits</strong> like blueberries, strawberries, and banana slices for a burst of vitamins and antioxidants. Add a handful of mixed <strong>nuts</strong> (like almonds and walnuts) for healthy fats and protein.</p>
        <p>Pair this with a <strong>green smoothie</strong> made from <strong>spinach</strong>, which is packed with iron, a banana for natural sweetness, and almond milk for a creamy texture. This combo will leave you feeling full and fueled until your next meal.</p>
        <div class="extra-info">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For an extra energy boost, sprinkle some chia seeds or flaxseeds on your oatmeal for an omega-3 punch!

        <p>Looking for something more hearty? Try a <strong>quinoa bowl</strong> filled with nutrient-rich black beans, sweet corn, and creamy avocado. Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids, making it a perfect plant-based protein source.</p>

        <p>Wind down your day with a nutritious <strong>baked salmon</strong> dinner. This omega-3 rich fish is paired with steamed <strong>broccoli</strong>, known for its cancer-fighting properties, and roasted sweet potatoes for a dose of vitamins A and C.</p>
        <p>If you prefer a plant-based option, enjoy <strong>stir-fried tofu</strong> with colorful vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini. Serve it over a bed of <strong>brown rice</strong> for a satisfying, fiber-packed meal.</p>
        <div class="extra-info">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Marinate your tofu in a bit of soy sauce, garlic, and sesame oil to enhance the flavor before stir-frying.

        <p>For something crunchy, munch on <strong>carrot sticks</strong> paired with creamy <strong>hummus</strong>. This is a great low-calorie, high-fiber snack that will keep you full without the guilt.</p>
